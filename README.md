## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Total Records**: 284,807 transactions
- **Fraudulent Transactions**: 492 (0.172%)
- **Features**:
  - `V1` to `V28`: PCA-transformed features
  - `Time`: Seconds elapsed between the first transaction and the current one
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount
  - `Class`: Target variable (0 = Legit, 1 = Fraud)

> ⚠️ Dataset is highly imbalanced, requiring special handling for model training.
